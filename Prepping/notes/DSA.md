# Data Structure And Algorithm

## Basically a way to organize and store the data faster.

## ADT: Abstract Data type
- Way of classifying data structures based on how they are used and behaviours they provide.

## Queue - FIFO
- Example: Standing in a queue in restaurant

## Stack - LIFO
- Example: Books are placed on one another

## Linear Search
- It is cheking the array one by one if it is the target value or not.
- O(n)

## Binary Search
- Here we calculate the mid value using the Start and End pointer.
- dsa/BasicsDSA.java
- O(Log n)

## Big O Notaion
- O(1): Constant Time
- **O(log n)**: lograthmic time it is **inbetween O(1) and O(n)**
- O(n): linear time
- O(nlog n):linearthmic time
- O(n^2): Quadratic time
- O(n!2): Factorial time
- O(2^n): Exponential time
