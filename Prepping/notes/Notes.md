## Notes

### Architecture

#### Layered Architeecture 
- Multiple layers and the functionalities are split accordingly 
- Each layer will have its own responsibility
- N-tier architecture
- Presentation layer , business layer , Persistance layer, database layer 
- Good for enterprise app but if the system gets complicated scaling is a problem.

#### Onion Architecture
- Core Logic is separated

### Hexagonal Architecture
- Adapting to the newer technology

### Modular Architecture
- Breaks down the system

### Microkernel Architecture
- Plugins can be added
- Example : Inteli J

### Event driven Architecture
- Decoupled systems
- Real time events

### CQRS
- Consist of Event bus
- Read and Write Operations are separated systematically

### Service Oriented Architecture(SOA)
- Independent systems to work together


### Clean Architecture
- Core functionalities stays same.
- More like Onion Architecture
