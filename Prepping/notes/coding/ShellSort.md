## It looks like you're working on a HackerRank problem involving a grasshopper jumping on a staircase. The task is to determine the lowest stair number (`startingStair`) such that, starting from this stair, the grasshopper will not go below stair 1 during its jumps. Here's how the problem can be solved:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. You are given an array `jumps[]` representing the number of steps the grasshopper will move up or down on each jump. A positive value in `jumps[i]` means the grasshopper moves `jumps[i]` steps up, and a negative value means it moves `|jumps[i]|` steps down.
2. The goal is to find the smallest `startingStair` such that the grasshopper can stay on the staircase (i.e., no step number becomes less than 1).

### Solution Approach:
To solve this problem, the following steps can be followed:

1. **Simulation of jumps**: For each possible starting stair (starting from 1 upwards), simulate the jumps until the grasshopper goes below stair number 1. The first starting stair where the grasshopper remains on the staircase (stair >= 1) for all jumps is the answer.

2. **Loop through possible starting stairs**: For each `startingStair`, simulate the sequence of jumps and check if the grasshopper ever goes below stair number 1. If it does, move to the next `startingStair`.

3. **Return the smallest valid starting stair**.

### Java Code:

```java
import java.util.List;

class Result {
    /*
     * Complete the 'findLowestStartingStair' function.
     *
     * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
     * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY jumps as parameter.
     */
    public static int findLowestStartingStair(List<Integer> jumps) {
        // Loop through each possible starting stair
        for (int startingStair = 1; startingStair <= jumps.size(); startingStair++) {
            int currentStair = startingStair;
            boolean valid = true;

            // Simulate jumps
            for (int jump : jumps) {
                currentStair += jump;
                if (currentStair < 1) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (valid) {
                return startingStair;
            }
        }
        return -1; // In case no valid starting stair is found
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example input: jumps = [1, -4, -2, 3]
        List<Integer> jumps = List.of(1, -4, -2, 3);
        int result = Result.findLowestStartingStair(jumps);
        System.out.println("The lowest starting stair is: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Simulation**: We iterate through each possible starting stair (`startingStair`). For each stair, we simulate the jumps and check if the grasshopper ever goes below stair 1.
- **Return value**: The function returns the first `startingStair` that keeps the grasshopper on the staircase at all times, or `-1` if no such stair is found.

### Example:
For the input:
```java
List<Integer> jumps = List.of(1, -4, -2, 3);
```
