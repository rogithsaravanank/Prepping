1. SQL

Structured Query Language – used to store, retrieve, update, delete data in relational databases.

2. Rotate String

Check if one string is rotation of another using:
(s1 + s1).contains(s2)

3. Clustering

Grouping related records to improve query performance (DB index clustering / ML concept).

4. Constraints

Rules on table columns (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK).

5. Elastic

Usually refers to Elasticsearch – distributed search & analytics engine.

6. Throw vs Throws

throw → explicitly throw exception

throws → declare exception in method signature


7. Rate Limiter

Limits number of requests per user/time.
Algorithms: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window.

8. Cache

Temporary fast storage (Redis, in-memory) to reduce DB calls.

9. Webhooks

HTTP callbacks triggered by events.

10. ORM / Mapping

Object Relational Mapping (Hibernate/JPA).


---

11. Binary Search

Divide & conquer on sorted array. O(log n)

12. Fetch vs Eager / Lazy

Eager → loads immediately

Lazy → loads when needed


13. Smart Traverse

Optimized iteration through structures.

14. COALESCE

Returns first non-null value.

15. DFS

Depth First Search.

16. List

Ordered collection, allows duplicates.

17. Duplicate & Delete

Use SQL:
DELETE FROM table WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id)...)

18. LinkedList

Doubly linked list.

19. Parallel Streams

Multi-threaded stream processing.

20. Thread

Lightweight execution unit.

21. Interceptor

Intercepts requests before controller.

22. Life Cycle of Bean (Spring)

Instantiate → Populate Properties → BeanNameAware → Init → Ready → Destroy


---

23. UNION vs JOIN

UNION → combine rows

JOIN → combine columns


24. Enable Auto Configuration

Spring Boot feature to configure automatically.

25. Reflection

Inspect class at runtime.

26. Bean

Spring managed object.

27. Tomcat vs Apache

Tomcat → Servlet container

Apache → Web server


28. Component Scan

Finds Spring beans.

29. Heap

Runtime memory.

30. Server Config Pool

Thread pool configuration.

31. Stack & Heap

Stack → method calls

Heap → objects


32. Final vs Finally vs Finalize

final → constant

finally → block

finalize → GC hook


33. JSON vs XML

JSON is lightweight.

34. Static vs Instance

Static → class level
Instance → object level

35. Architecture of JVM

ClassLoader → Runtime Memory → Execution Engine → GC

36. Domain & Handler Mapping

Spring maps URL → controller.

37. ClassCastException

Wrong type cast.
